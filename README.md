Blackjack, a card game also known as 21, is the most popular gambling game in the world. The game is based on the fact that the total value of the cards that the player owns is 21. If the total is less than 21, the player can choose to draw a card until the value reaches 21, or to a lower value that makes him ask for another card, or to exceed 21. The winner is the one who has the hand ( The set of cards he has) with a value of 21 or close to it, without exceeding it. The game is played in different ways in casinos with different rules. Most of the game's popularity comes from several factors including chance of winning, skill, and popularity of card counting (a process by which one can predict which cards have not yet been dealt).

In casino blackjack, the dealer faces one to seven players behind a kidney-shaped table. Each player plays against the dealer independently. At the beginning of each hand, the player places his bet in the "bet box" and receives a hand of two cards. The goal of the game is for the player to get a card value higher than the dealer's but without going over 21, which in this case is called busting, breaking, or other names. The cards count from 2 to 9, and as for 10, the jack, girl and old man count as 10. As for the ace, it can be 1 or 11, depending on the player's choice. The player starts the game by taking an extra card to the hand he already has if he wants. If this card leads to exceeding the value of the cards 21, he loses, then the dealer plays with his hand, and if he also exceeds 21, he loses in front of all players. If no one crosses 21, whoever has the hand with the highest value or has a value of 21 wins.
